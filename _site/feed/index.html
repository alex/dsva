      <description>&lt;h3&gt;In a galaxy, far far away.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log was gone. &amp;quot;I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See to it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There he goes now; to him nothing&amp;#39;s happened; but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip&amp;#39;s missing. Let&amp;#39;s see now if ye haven&amp;#39;t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he&amp;#39;s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! there&amp;#39;s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off&amp;mdash;we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here&amp;#39;s Pip, trying to get on board again.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Peace, thou crazy loon,&amp;quot; cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. &amp;quot;Away from the quarter-deck!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,&amp;quot; muttered Ahab, advancing. &amp;quot;Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy? &amp;quot;Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through! Who art thou, boy?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Bell-boy, sir; ship&amp;#39;s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high&amp;mdash;looks cowardly&amp;mdash;quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who&amp;#39;s seen Pip the coward?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab&amp;#39;s cabin shall be Pip&amp;#39;s home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let&amp;#39;s down.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See to it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;There he goes now; to him nothing&amp;#39;s happened; but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip&amp;#39;s missing. Let&amp;#39;s see now if ye haven&amp;#39;t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he&amp;#39;s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here.&lt;/p&gt;
